Hi, I'm Sandeep 👋🏻

I’m a generalist in security, operator and leader with over 12 years of experience in different security and operational functions . I’ve held both individual contributor and leadership roles across various disciplines such as vulnerability disclosure and bug bounties, detection and response, and security consulting domains of pentesting, application security, cloud and devops security. I’ve also helped build and manage local and regional communities in the past. I enjoy learning new things, and I like to fall into new rabbit holes every now and then.
